Abstract
His philosophical views on the collection of Abay's words of edification.
In this article, the words of edification of Abay Kunanbai are analyzed, and the question " are the problems of the Kazakh people relevant in today's collection?", "What is the main idea of this collection?", "What is the importance of Nazidani Abay in today's generation?" and "What is the role of Abay's words of edification in the history of Kazakhstan?".
Keywords: Edification of Abai, Abai Kunanbayev, Kazakh mentality, relevance of edification;
<br><br>
The edification of Abai is one of the most famous works of Abai Kunanbayev, in which he describes his philosophical views on life, on development, on the negative qualities of people (such as greed, greed, flattery for profit, deception, etc.), in particular on the negative qualities that were inherent in the Kazakh people of those times. In his work, Abai vividly expresses his concern about the problems of the Kazakh people and openly admits his helplessness in the fight against them. In total, the collection contains 45 edifications and philosophical parables, which are based on the deep experiences and reflections of Abai Kunanbayev.
<br><br>In words of edification, Abai considers the problems of the Kazakh people not from the point of view of physical wealth, but from the point of view of spiritual wealth.
<br><br>It should be noted that Abai wrote a collection of words of edification in his old age, that is, having seen the full life is vividly displayed in the first word of edification [1]:<i>"Well I lived or bad, and passed a lot in the fight and quarrels, disputes and the courts, pains, and anxieties came to a ripe old age, exhausted, sated all, has discovered the frailty and futility of their actions, convinced of the humiliation of his being..."</i>
<br><br>The following words describe the problems of education, moral values, chauvinism, diligence and honor of the Kazakh people.
<br><br>In particular, Abai Kunanbayev criticizes Kazakhs for their greed and theft. This is vividly shown in his eleventh edification [2]:
"... this is how they live: a nobleman - helping a bai and aiding a thief, a poor man - playing along with those in power, supporting them in disputes, joining one party or another, for a great living sacrificing his own honor, selling his wife, children, relatives...".
<br><br>The edification of Abai is one of the most famous works of Abai Kunanbayev, in which he describes his philosophical views on life, on development, on the negative qualities of people (such as greed, greed, flattery for profit, deception, etc.), in particular on the negative qualities that were inherent in the Kazakh people of those times. In his work, Abai vividly expresses his concern about the problems of the Kazakh people, and openly admits his helplessness in the fight against them. In total, the collection contains 45 Edifications and philosophical parables, which are based on the deep experiences and reflections of Abai Kunanbayev.
<br><br>The poet in his work spoke about strengthening the power of the country, the state and national unity. He promoted the idea of creating a just society. These views of Abai are especially valuable in the XXI century for the Kazakh society, its unity and well-being. Sage Abai's installations correspond to the principles of a civilized state. Justice will be firmly established only if the rule of law, openness of the government and accountability to the people are at a high level, and representatives of civil society are actively involved in the affairs of the state.
<br><br>As The President Kasym Zhomart Kemelulu said [3]:<i>"If we turn to Abai's writings, we will clearly see that he sincerely wanted to improve and develop his people, this idea runs through all his works like a red thread."</i><br><br>It is known that the basis of progress is education and science. And Abai wished with all his heart that Kazakhs were constantly learning, mastering new knowledge. The meaning of his words "Do not brag until you master science" is that you cannot reach heights without mastering knowledge. In another of his instructions, "Master science not in order to get rich," he emphasized that studying science is necessary for the prosperity of his people. This is how other words of the Great Abai should be understood: "Do not think about profit, think about honor, strive for knowledge." This understanding is extremely relevant today. Strictly speaking, it has become even more relevant than ever, because we see how the science of the XXI century is rapidly moving to new heights. And our task is not only to keep up with progress, but also to get to the forefront. Abai especially emphasized that one of the good deeds is the study of foreign languages. The poet in the twenty-fifth word of his book "Words of Edification" wrote that it gives a person knowledge of a foreign language: "Having studied the language and culture of other peoples, a person becomes equal among them, is not humiliated by worthless requests." In other words, in order to become equal with more developed nations, it is very important to learn their languages.
<br><br>The world is changing not every day, but every hour. New horizons and previously unknown prospects are emerging in all areas. New scientific knowledge serves the progress of mankind. The time has come when only knowledge will allow you to get ahead. To keep up with the times, we need to have a clear open mind. This step requires the ability to combine the best achievements of modern civilization with our national goals. At such a time, we must abandon our old customs and habits that do not correspond to modernity. That is why Abai, constantly critically assessing some of people's actions, said: "They do not seek deep reflection, deep knowledge, they only lie and spread rumors." The poet encouraged people to master different types of art. He was clearly aware that this was a requirement of the time, and constantly spoke about it to his people. We can say that the idea of forming an intellectual nation, which we are talking about today, originates from Abai. Every word of the great thinker was aimed at the development and improvement of his people.
<br><br>In his "Words of Edification", Abai, having exalted the common heritage of mankind, ascended to an unprecedented spiritual height, far ahead of his time. His "Words of Edification" are based on humanity, culture and kindness. The main mission of Abai's "Words of Edification" is to make others think, reflect, and determine the target settings. The "Words of Edification" of the great thinker is a very valuable work. The higher we can raise the name of Abai in the world culture, the higher the authority of our country will be. In the modern era of globalization and information technology, the word of Abai should make all people on the planet think.
<br><br>There are enough personalities in the world who have made a significant contribution to the development of various fields of science and education and have been recognized as universal thinkers. For example, at the word "China" we immediately recall Lao Tzu and Confucius, at the word "Russia" Dostoevsky and Tolstoy come to mind, at the word "France" we recall Voltaire and Rousseau. Also, we must reach such a level that at the mention of Kazakhstan, we would immediately remember the name of Abai. It would be a great honor if foreigners, welcoming us, would say: "The Kazakh people are the people of Abai." Abai's merits cannot be overestimated. His instructive life and genuine creativity are a role model not only for the Kazakh people, but also for the whole world. Abai's ideas about man and society, education and science, religion and traditions, nature and the environment, the state and government, language and communication have not lost their significance for centuries, because the poet's legacy is the spiritual origins for all mankind.
<br><br>As long as there are Kazakh people, the name of Abai will always be in demand. If we hold his precious words high as a spiritual treasure, then the authority of our motherland in the world will certainly increase.
